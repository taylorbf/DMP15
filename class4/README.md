# Class 4: Object-Oriented Programming

## Describing an Object

#### Properties (Characteristics)

A fruitfly might have the following properties:

```
flyX
flyY
flySize
flySpeed
zapPower

```

#### Methods (Actions)

What can the object *do*.

For a fruitfly, we might say that it can move:

```
flyX = flyX + random(-5,5);
flyY = flyY + random(-5,5);
```

An object's actions usually involve changing one or more of its properties (characteristics).



## Context



## Assignment

Decide on a digital `object` you will build in class over the next 4 days. 

This might be a model of a real-life object, or a colorful object that can be used for algorithmic painting. It should have a visual dimension and be able to change in some way.

Later this week, we will encapsulate this object and be able to create many (100+) instances of it within a sketch.

Consider:

- What does it look like?
- How does it move or change?
	- constant change?
	- logical boundaries?
	
**On Day 5, be able to describe your object to us in terms of what properties (variables) it will need and what kind of actions it will do.**
