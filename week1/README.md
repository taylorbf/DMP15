# Due this week

### By Friday @ 11:59 PM

1) Propose an idea for your final project, which will be due on the last day of the online portion of the class. This project may involve:

- Video processing by hacking/editing one of the video templates in Class 8.
- Further exploration of your Class (but it should be significant)
- Exploration of a new Class. If so, tell us what it will be called, and what it will do.
- Another idea!

2) Write a code poem.




Commit some code which is the barebones beginning of your Final Project. Examples: 

  - If doing video processing, choose which of the template sketches you plan to work with, and commit a copy of it in your own folder.
  - If creating a new class, write a sketch with an empty class definition and give it a name. Add a few comments that describe what the class will do.
