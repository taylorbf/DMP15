# Iteration (Loops)



## Loops

#### for

Use a `for` loop to loop through code any number of times.

```
for (int i=0; i<100; i=i+1) {

   // code in here will happen 100 times

}
```

#### i

In the above example, `i` is an index variable that counts upward during each iteration.

`i` will equal 0 the first time through the loop, then 1, then, 2, etc. You can use `i` just as you could use any variable. 

This will draw a straight line that is 100 points long:

```
for (int i=0; i<100; i=i+1) {

   point(i,10);

}
```

## Context


## Reflection

Where do you see iteration in nature?

Imagine a simple action from your daily life. What could you achieve if you could easily do that action 100 times or 100,000 times?

## Assignment

- Finish Project 1 (an interactive artwork). Be prepared to give a 10-15 minute presentation in which you explain your code to the class.
