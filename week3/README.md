#### Submit your Final Project

Post your final project to the discussion board (or tell us where to find the final sketch on GitHub). 

Create a short video (about 5 minutes or less) that shows off your sketch, demonstrates its interactivity if necessary, and that walks us through a little bit of your code. You are all exploring different coding techniques in your projects; consider this an opportunity to teach the rest of the class about what you've learned in this project. 

You also might want to mention how your project changed between proposal and completion, and what opportunities you see with your sketch (or the code techniques you learned) in the future.
