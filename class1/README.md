# Shapes and Movement



## Structure of a Sketch

#### Setup and Draw

```
// the setup function gets called once when the sketch loads

void setup() {

}


// the draw function gets called at 60 fps

void draw() {

}
```

## Shapes

#### point
Draw a point at an x/y position

point( x, y )

```
point(10,10)
```

## Variables

It's important to choose the right kind of variable for your needs.

#### Boolean

A boolean can have one of two values: `true` or `false`. It is like a lightswitch, either on or off, like a binary operator.

`boolean IamBen = true;`

#### Integer

An integer is a whole number, such as `0`, `1`, `-2`, etc. It cannot be a decimal number.

`int x = 100`

#### Float

A float number may be either a whole number or decimal.

`float money = 10.50`


#### String

A String is a piece of text. Specifically, it is non-code text, like regular English.

`String greeting = "Yo, what's up?"`

A string has a length.

```
int x = greeting.length
// x now equals 14
```

## Operators

Variables or numbers may be operated on after they are defined

```
int x = 10
x = x / 2
// x is now 5
x = x + 2
// x is now 7
```
