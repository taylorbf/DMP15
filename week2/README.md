#### Rough Draft

Share a rough draft of your final project with the class. Post to the discussion board telling us which parts of the project you've accomplished so far and what you'd still like to add. This also might be a good time to ask the class for coding advice if you are stuck on an aspect of the project.

Be sure to attach your Processing sketch to the post, or commit/sync your sketch on GitHub, so that we can see your project draft.
